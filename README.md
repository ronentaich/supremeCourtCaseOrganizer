# supremeCourtCaseOrganizer

This is a c++ group project that was made in our data structures class during the Fall 2019 quarter. It takes supreme court cases from a txt file and uses trees, 
doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, and other data structures to organize them and give the user several options and ways to interact 
with the data.
